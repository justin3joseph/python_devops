# Lab 01 — AWS Identity

## 🎯 Objective

Use Boto3 STS to identify the current AWS account.

By completing this lab, students should understand how this technique can be used in a real DevOps automation workflow.

## 📚 Theory

### Why this matters in DevOps

DevOps scripts commonly automate repetitive server, application, configuration, monitoring, and deployment tasks. Python provides standard-library modules and widely used third-party libraries for these tasks.

### Key concepts


Boto3 provides Python access to AWS services. Credentials should come from the AWS environment/profile, never hard-coded in scripts.

## 🧩 Task

Complete **Lab 01 — AWS Identity**.

Start with the smallest working version. Test it, inspect the output, then improve it.

## 💡 Hints

- Break the task into small functions or steps.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Print intermediate values while learning.
- Handle expected errors instead of allowing confusing tracebacks.
- Test both the normal case and at least one failure case.

## ▶️ Expected Output

Your output should clearly show that the requested operation completed successfully.

Example style:

```text
========================================
        DEVOPS LAB 1
========================================
Task completed successfully
Result      : <actual result>
Status      : PASS
========================================
```

Actual values will depend on the student's system.

## ✅ Solution

```python
import boto3

identity = boto3.client("sts").get_caller_identity()

print("Account:", identity["Account"])
print("ARN    :", identity["Arn"])
```

## 🔍 Solution Explanation

1. Import the required module(s).
2. Collect or process the required data.
3. Perform the requested automation.
4. Handle errors where appropriate.
5. Display a clear result.

Students should understand **why** each step is required, not simply copy the code.

## 🧪 Student Practice

Modify the solution to add one useful improvement.

Suggested variations:

- Add input validation.
- Add a timestamp.
- Save the result to a file.
- Add a warning threshold.
- Process multiple inputs.
- Add a command-line option.
- Handle an expected failure gracefully.

Write the improved version yourself before looking at the solution above again.
