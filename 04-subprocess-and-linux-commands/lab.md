# Lab 01 — Run Linux Commands

## 🎯 Objective

Run `hostname`, `date`, `uptime`, and `whoami` from Python.

By completing this lab, students should understand how this technique can be used in a real DevOps automation workflow.

## 📚 Theory

### Why this matters in DevOps

DevOps scripts commonly automate repetitive server, application, configuration, monitoring, and deployment tasks. Python provides standard-library modules and widely used third-party libraries for these tasks.

### Key concepts


`subprocess.run()`, command arguments, captured output, return codes, exceptions, and automation around Linux commands.

## 🧩 Task

Complete **Lab 01 — Run Linux Commands**.

Start with the smallest working version. Test it, inspect the output, then improve it.

## 💡 Hints

- Break the task into small functions or steps.
- Use meaningful variable names.
- Print intermediate values while learning.
- Handle expected errors instead of allowing confusing tracebacks.
- Test both the normal case and at least one failure case.

## ▶️ Expected Output

Your output should clearly show that the requested operation completed successfully.

Example style:

```text
========================================
        DEVOPS LAB 1
========================================
Task completed successfully
Result      : <actual result>
Status      : PASS
========================================
```

Actual values will depend on the student's system.

## ✅ Solution

```python
import subprocess

commands = [["hostname"], ["date"], ["uptime"], ["whoami"]]

for command in commands:
    result = subprocess.run(command, capture_output=True, text=True)
    print(result.stdout.strip())
```

## 🔍 Solution Explanation

1. Import the required module(s).
2. Collect or process the required data.
3. Perform the requested automation.
4. Handle errors where appropriate.
5. Display a clear result.

Students should understand **why** each step is required, not simply copy the code.

## 🧪 Student Practice

Modify the solution to add one useful improvement.

Suggested variations:

- Add input validation.
- Add a timestamp.
- Save the result to a file.
- Add a warning threshold.
- Process multiple inputs.
- Add a command-line option.
- Handle an expected failure gracefully.

Write the improved version yourself before looking at the solution above again.

```

## ✅ Solution

```python
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(
    ["df", "-h", "/"],
    capture_output=True,
    text=True
)

print(result.stdout)
print("Return code:", result.returncode)
```

# Lab 03 — Handle Command Errors

## 🎯 Objective

Detect failed commands and display useful errors.
